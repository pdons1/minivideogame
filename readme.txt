Theme:
The theme of my game is based around my pet leopard gecko kismet. Her favorite activity is eating, so I decided to make the game centered around her and a search for food. She avoids the sun because it is really harsh on a leopard geckos eyes. 

Customizations:
The customizations I chose to implement were the adding of multiple items to collect (crickets and meal worms) and a click feature(to make the suns go away). First, when it came to the crickets, they’re like the simple ‘G’s in the demo. However, the mealworms are much different. First they have a lower chance of being generated by using 2 random number generators instead of just one. Now if the user is lucky enough to have the meal worms generated, they function much differently then the crickets which just simply add 5 points to your score. If you pick up meal worms, and your score is negative, it brings your score back up all the way to 0. If you pick up meal worms when you have a score of 0 or greater, then you get 10 points added to your score. The suns in the game are what you are trying to avoid, and they subtract 5 points from your score. Because so many suns are generated to make the game trickier, the user gets 6 chanced to click suns and make them disappear therefore they never get ran into. The amount of clicks the user has left is shown in the title bar. Also, if you look at the console while the game is running, it gives you messages every time you hit something. Finally, I created a splash screen with all of the instructions on it and a picture of kismet, the gecko the game is based upon. 

Overall vision:
My idea for the game was to make it difficult, there is an aggressive amount of suns generated to make it so with a very high score that must be obtained to win (75). That being said I wanted it to be fun and winnable which is why I came up with the click idea. As for my theme I think it makes it unique to me because nobody else (as far as I know) has a pet gecko named kismet, so my game will stand out as well as mean something to me.

Implementation:
To create my click feature, I did not have to create a method as the handlelclick that was already made worked perfectly. Simply put, the handle click method allows the user to click a specific spot on the grid, and if it is filled with a sun then it is replaced with nothing, and if it wasn’t filled with a sun, or the user is out of their 6 clicks then nothing happens. For the splash screen I created a new method called splash screen that I made and then called in the play method. It acts very similar to the pause button but instead has the instructions and waits for a click to begin the game. Every other function that was added to the game was created in a method that was given and fit appropriately in. 

Most proud:
I would say the “sun blocker” click function is my most proud piece of the game because it is the most different from the demo game but also because I had to come up with the whole thing by myself, there was no given code besides the one println. This means that this customization is completely mine, where as other ideas were most of an extension to the demo game.
